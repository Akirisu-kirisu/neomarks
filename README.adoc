= PinBoard

[IMPORTANT]
All the credits for the idea for the plugin goes to
https://github.com/ThePrimeagen[ThePrimegean] and his plugin
https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon[harpoon]. I highly suggest you to watch
is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnos8aApa9g[vimconf video] to understand the
usage of this plugin.

A new take on vim marks.

== Why

Harpoon is great and all but as a lot of features that I don't really need and
depends on `plenary.nvim`. This plugin focus on minimalism, do the minimum set
of features to be usable and use only neovim standard functions.

== Quickstart

=== Installation

Using your favorite Package manager:

....
"saccarosium/pinboard.nvim"
....

Put it directly in your config:

[,sh]
----
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saccarosium/pinboard.nvim/main/lua/pinboard.lua -o "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim/lua/pinboard.lua
----

=== Setup

Call the `setup` function (the following are the defaults):

[,lua]
----
require("pinboard").setup({
  storagefile = vim.fn.stdpath('data') .. "/pinboard.json",
  ui = {
    title = "Pinned Files",
    title_pos = "center",
    border = "rounded",
    width = 60,
    height = 10,
  }
})
----

Now you can remap as you wish the following functions:

[,lua]
----
require("pinboard").mark_file() -- Mark file
require("pinboard").ui_toogle() -- Toggle the UI
require("pinboard").jump_to(<number>) -- Jump to specific index
----
